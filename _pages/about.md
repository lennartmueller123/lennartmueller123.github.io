My name is Lennart Müller, and I am a dedicated professional with a background in finance and computer engineering. I am passionate about utilising data analytics and technology to develop impactful solutions, with a keen interest in using AI and machine learning to solve complex problems. My experience includes developing analytics tools, collaborating with interdisciplinary teams and working on innovative projects in both corporate and academic environments. I am committed to continuous learning and want to contribute to advances that make a meaningful difference.

Experience
======
I have a strong academic background in finance and computer engineering. My professional experience includes working at UniCredit Bank AG, where I performed in-depth data analyses, developed financial reports and created a KPI tracking dashboard for strategic decision making. I also gained valuable interdisciplinary experience at Pickware GmbH in Business Development and Customer Support, where I worked closely with programmers to troubleshoot software issues and manage product development. These roles have equipped me with a solid mix of analytical, technical and collaborative skills that I look forward to utilising on future data-driven projects.

Academic Background
======
I hold a strong academic foundation that began with my Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering, specializing in Mechanical Engineering, from the Technical University of Darmstadt. Building on this, I pursued a Master’s degree in Management and Technology with a specialization in Finance and Computer Engineering at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). To further expand my expertise, I completed an Accelerated Certificate Program (ACP) in Data Science at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). 
This diverse academic background has provided me with a unique blend of engineering, financial analysis, and data science skills that position me well for tackling complex analytical challenges.
