This project is the final Capstone of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. It simulates a real-world consulting scenario for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company in Chicago, to uncover data-driven insights that inform business decisions and strategic marketing efforts.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Key Features:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Business Problem Definition:</strong><br/>
    The primary goal was to understand the behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members and identify data-backed strategies to convert casual riders into subscribers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Robust Data Cleaning & Preparation:</strong><br/>
    12 months of ride data were wrangled using Pandas, including handling nulls, outliers, and inconsistent formatting across over 5.6 million rows.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong><br/>
    Applied descriptive statistics, correlation matrices, and visual analytics to extract trends in ride duration, frequency, day-of-week usage, and station patterns using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Key Insights:</strong><br/>
    Casual riders were more likely to ride on weekends, use docked bikes, and have shorter trip durationsâ€”insights that shaped targeted marketing recommendations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Actionable Recommendations:</strong><br/>
    Suggested strategies include incentivized loyalty programs, targeted weekday promotions, and app-based nudging to convert casual users to members.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Presentation & Storytelling:</strong><br/>
    Delivered results through a Jupyter Notebook and professional visual dashboard, translating technical findings into actionable business language for non-technical stakeholders.
  </li>
</ol>
